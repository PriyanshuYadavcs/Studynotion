The { timestamps: true } option in Mongoose automatically adds two fields to your schema:

createdAt: Stores the date and time when the document was first created.
updatedAt: Stores the date and time when the document was last updated.

In the context of your schema definition, trim: true is a Mongoose option used for String fields. It automatically removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the value before it gets saved to the database.

For example, if a user enters an email address like " example@example.com ", the trim: true option will ensure that the spaces are removed, and the value "example@example.com" is saved

In the context of databases and programming, enum (short for enumeration) is a special data type that defines a set of predefined, fixed values that a variable can take. In your example, enum: ["Admin", "Student", "audience"], the accountType field can only have one of these three values: "Admin", "Student", or "audience".
