what does this index true means
ans = index: true for a field creates an index for that field in the MongoDB database. Indexes improve query performance by allowing the database to quickly locate and retrieve records that match the search criteria for that field.

.exec(): This method explicitly executes the query. In Mongoose, queries like .find() or .findById() return a query object, not a promise, unless .exec() is used. Calling .exec() converts the query into a promise, which allows the use of await for asynchronous operations.

The {} inside the find() method is the query object. It tells MongoDB how to filter the documents from the collection.
In this case, the object { _id: { $ne: categoryId } } is specifying a condition that involves the _id field of the documents.


const mostSellingCourses = allCourses.sort((a, b) => b.sold - a.sold).slice(0, 10);

If b.sold - a.sold is positive (i.e., b.sold is greater than a.sold), it returns a positive number, which tells the sort() function that b should come before a.
If b.sold - a.sold is negative (i.e., a.sold is greater than b.sold), it returns a negative number, which tells the sort() function that a should come before b.
If b.sold - a.sold is zero, it means both have the same sold value, so their order remains unchanged relative to each other.
